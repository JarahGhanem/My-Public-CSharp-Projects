    i Studied For the First Time the Famous Programming Language "Python",
    well, when i lied when i said i've studyid in Fact i remembered that i Hate Studying!
    i've just learnet some Python code that only outpot the word "Hello World!",
    And with the passage of years, i've Learnet something called "C# Programming Language"
    or "Object Oriented Programming Languages (OOP)" and with the First Project that i made
    with C#, and Learnet alot about C# over the year, it was Great Experience,
    and that why i intersted in programmaing, and in Fact that i think Without
    Programming and Technology, we can't use The Web anymore, Fun Fact, respiratory 
    Devices are coded in C Langauge !
